You can chop a package of strawberries (they cost a dime now!) into cubes and cook with half a cup of sugar in a saucepan until it becomes a thick paste, and load on the cold cake. You can mix a cup of sour cream with 2 tablespoons of sugar and spread it on the cake in the last 10 minutes of baking. You can pour a hot and decadent toffee sauce over it.",
